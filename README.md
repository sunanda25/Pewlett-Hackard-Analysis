# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview
An HR analyst of Pewlett-Hackard company is given a task to identify employees who will be retiring soon and how many positions need to be filled. Data regarding employees is stored in CSV files which is not very efficient for analysis. To overcome this, data in CSV files were imported to database tables to perform analysis using SQL. Upon presenting the analysis to the manager, a subsequent request was made to gather the below details:

- Determine the number of retiring employees per title
- Identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program

## Results

- The development department has the highest number of employees eligible (396) for the mentorship program.
- Assuming all 1,549 employees are willing to participate in the mentorship program, this would mean that each mentor would have an average of 58 mentees. Having 58 mentees per mentor may not be an ideal scenario for mentoring the next generation of Pewelett-Hackard employees.
